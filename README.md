I will be be buiding a simple recipe website, which would consist of a index page that contains links to a couple of recipes.

I will demonstrate all of the skills that I learned the past couple lessons. The main skills in the lesson include:

-handwriting an html boilerplate
-creating paragraphs and headings
-making texts bold, italicized, or both
-making un/ordered lists
-making working links and making them secure and safe
-adding images, being able to add alternative text and changing the scale.
-nesting everything correctly and indenting to make the code look readable and neat
