        <h2>Description:</h2>
            <p>Dolly Parton and Rachel Parton George's famous biscuit recipe is the perfect addition to any party. Just don't skimp on the bacon grease!</p>
            <p>We admit it—we love the way that butter or some sort of grease makes food taste, especially bacon grease. That's why we use it to cook up country ham. I use it more than Rachel, so I have people save their bacon grease for me. I tell them, "Don't throw away your bacon grease!" And when somebody says, "How do you keep your skin looking so good?" I tell them, "Bacon grease...from the inside out!" — <strong>Dolly Parton</strong></p>
            <p>This is one of my favorite recipes from many years ago, and it is still a fantastic biscuit! Also, these are so easy to start in the food processor, which I often use to save time. If you don't have one, you can also mix your dry ingredients and cut in your shortening and butter by hand like Mama used to. She was so good at cooking and making biscuits that she could just work the dough by hand and before you knew it, the whole pan would be coming out of the oven!" — <strong>Rachel Parton George</strong></p>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1/4 cup shortening, plus more for greasing</li>
                <li>3 cups flour, plus more for dusting</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar</li>
                <li>1/2 cup cold butter, cut into 1/2-inch pieces</li>
                <li>1 1/4 cups whole buttermilk</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon bacon grease or shortening</li>
                <li>3 slices country ham</li>
                <li>softened butter, for serving</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch cast-iron skillet with shortening.</li>
                <li>In a large mixing bowl or the bowl of a food processor, sift together flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and cream of tartar. Mix or pulse a few times to combine</li>
                <li>Cut butter and 1/4 cup shortening into flour mixture just until you get a crumbly consistency. Add buttermilk to flour mixture. Gently stir until just combined, being careful not to overmix.</li>
                <li>Turn out dough onto a floured surface. With floured hands, pat dough to approximately 2-inch thickness. Using a 2 1/2-inch biscuit cutter, cut out 6 to 8 biscuits. Transfer to greased skillet. Bake until golden brown, about 30 minutes. Remove biscuits from oven and let cool 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>While biscuits are baking, cook ham: Add bacon grease to a cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Add ham slices and fry until edges are brown, a few minutes per side. Remove ham from skillet and place on a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Cut each slice in half.</li>
                <li>To serve, split each biscuit in half, spread with softened butter, and sandwich with a piece of ham.</li>
            </ol>
